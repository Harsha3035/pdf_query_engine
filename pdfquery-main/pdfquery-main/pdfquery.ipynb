The completion of one \\nhundred years is a major milestone in the history of any organization.  The \\ncommemoration of the Centenary of NDMC is obviously a  time for us to \\ncelebrate, but even more so, a time to celebrate our history.  The success story \\nof NDMC is now a century old and marks the contributio n of so many known and \\nunknown personalities who added significantly to its g rowth.  I stand here first & \\nforemost to pay our tribute to the vision and dedication  of our past leaders, \\nexecutives and thousands of employees, workers who ha ve worked with \\nceaseless passion to build up this organization over th e past century. \\n \\n1.2  The last 100 years were, for NDMC, the era of in frastructure \\ndevelopment, the dawn of a British Capital and the dawn  of a resurgent free \\nIndia\\'s Capital.  Today we stand on the shoulders of g iants to feel possessive \\nabout the most prestigeous Municipal area in the country,  in our further resolve \\nto provide best practices, state of the Art and globaly co mpetetive technology in \\nthe service of our inhabitants, as also our duty to attemp t a vision for the next \\ncentury\\'s picture of NDMC area. \\n \\n1.3  With these words, I now present Annual Budget 2014 -15.  \\n \\n2.  I will present the financial projections first. The  revised estimates for \\nrevenue receipts in 2013-14 are projected at ` ` `` 2490.64 crore 2490.64 crore 2490.64 crore 2490.64 crore against `2356.91 `2356.91 `2356.91 `2356.91 \\ncrore crore crore crore provided in BE 2013-14.  The revised estimates  for revenue expenditure in \\n2013-14 are projected at `2489.46 `2489.46 `2489.46 `2489.46 crore crore crore crore as against `2021.57 crore `2021.57 crore `2021.57 crore `2021.57 crore provided in \\nBE 2013-14.

This \\nbudget attempts and showcases an organic and sustainable  growth.   2 \\n  \\n3.  I will now mention the function-wise performance and achievements in \\nthe major areas during 2013-14, and the plans and pro jections for the year  \\n2014-15. \\n    \\nROADS AND PAVEMENTS ROADS AND PAVEMENTS ROADS AND PAVEMENTS ROADS AND PAVEMENTS     \\n    \\n3.1  Our attempt is to move towards longer-duration and r epair-free \\ntechnology for roads especially in residential areas  so as to minimise  citizens\\' \\ndiscomfort. The RCC (Reinforced Cement Concrete) road s in Lodhi Colony have \\nbeen completed and in Bharti Nagar Colony the work wil l be completed within \\nthis financial year. The work of laying cement concre te roads in the residential \\ncolony Sarojini Nagar has also been completed.  The  RMC work of DIZ area, \\nSector-II is in progress and will be completed in the  next financial year. \\n \\n3.2  Resurfacing of roads in Khan Market area through  bituminous mastic \\ntreatment has been completed and work is in progress  at B.K. Dutt Colony, \\nAliganj and Jor Bagh. \\n \\n3.3  Resurfacing of road through micro-surfacing trea tment as \\nrecommended by CRRI is in progress at 34 roads and m icro-surfacing is \\ncomplete at Ashoka Road and Ferozshah Road.  Another 6 roads with micro-\\nsurfacing will be completed in the next financial yea r.  In addition, to minimise \\nthe time and costs towards repairs especially of pothol es and small cuts in roads, \\nwe are experimenting with the model of hot mix patches a nd microsurfacing as \\nthe technology of choice.  \\n \\n3.4  To further continue our Road Improvement Program me, CRRI has been \\nrequested for evaluation and to give recommendations f or another 24 roads in \\nNDMC area for resurfacing of roads. \\n    \\n    \\n    3 \\n Resurfacing of colony road by bituminous concrete in  Bharti Nagar and \\ngolf Link and resurfacing of roads in the colony Rab indra Nagar, Lodhi Estate and \\nPandara Road will be carried out during the next finan cial year including the \\nimprovement of the back lane of Jor Bagh Colony. \\n    \\n3.5  Improvement of walkways in Lodhi Colony, Jor Ba gh Road, IInd Avenue \\nand Man Singh Road and improvement of the roundabout i n Bengali Market will \\nbe carried out during the next financial year, reducin g the number of non-\\nfunctional fountains to avoid water wastage and stagnation , and instead \\ndeveloping greenary & horticulture.    \\n \\n3.6  A provision of `108.76 crore `108.76 crore `108.76 crore `108.76 crore has been kept for Roads and Pavements i n \\nBE 2014-15, out of which `50.20 `50.20 `50.20 `50.20 crore crore crore crore are for capital expenditure.  \\n    \\n4. 4. 4. 4.        REDEVELOPMENT OF CONNAUGHT PLACE REDEVELOPMENT OF CONNAUGHT PLACE REDEVELOPMENT OF CONNAUGHT PLACE REDEVELOPMENT OF CONNAUGHT PLACE    \\n    \\n4.1  The grandeur of Connaught Place has been revive d with the \\ncompletion of Redevelopment of Connaught Place Projec t which  included façade \\nrestoration of 12 blocks, Regal Building and P-Block ;  surface development at \\nInner Circle, Radial Roads and Outer circle alongwith  parking area and public \\nplaza.   Besides, five existing subways and two new subways at Gopal Dass \\nBhawan and Statesman House have been completed.  Twenty -two escalators \\nhave also been provided as per the site feasibility a nd are now in public use. \\n \\n4.2  Dedicated pedestrian corridors at Inner Circle, Middle Circle, Radial \\nRoads and Outer Circle have been created which are in ter-connected through \\ntabletops for the safety and security of the pedestrians,  and are user-friendly for \\nthe disabled.  Display of the block names in Braille language is another salient \\nfeature. \\n    \\n4.3  The Service Corridor (Utility Duct Tunnel) at Midd le Circle, Connaught \\nPlace is complete and various utility services such a s water supply, electricity, \\ntelecommunication services etc., are now being run thr ough this service corridor.  \\nThis tunnel was opened for visit by the general public  for ten days, and we join 4 \\n the general public in appreciation of hard-work of ou r engineers.  The control \\nroom for the service corridor will commence shortly w ith an O&M for it.  The \\nenormity of the project can be gauged by the fact that for  the past century, \\nthere were almost no instances of subterranean repairs , inspection or even clear \\nmaps & plans of these tunnels. \\n \\n4.4  The mechanized housekeeping in Connaught Place at corridors, public \\nplaza, footpaths, parking areas, toilets, subways etc. w ill be carried out in the \\ncoming years under Design, Built, Operate & Transfer (DBOT) basis with \\nprovision for installation of street furniture by the co ncessionaire.   \\n \\n4.5  Connaught Place/ Circus, or Rajiv Chowk/ Indira  Chowk as it stands \\nrenamed since 1995, is the pride of NDMC area.  The work is by no means \\nentirely as per our commitment to ourselves, yet the c rowds that eventually \\nthronged the C.P. Festival did point to the enthusiasm and  never-say-die attitude \\nof the Delhi Shopper to grab sales offers. \\n \\n  Areas such as Scindia House, Middle Circle and the  Radial Roads, left \\nout during 2010, will be more exhaustively planned fo r revival.  We envisage \\nthat some day soon, the tunnel infrastructure can be use d for  Centralised Air-\\nConditioning of the Connaught Place Complex and even th e surrounding multi-\\nstoreyed buildings, apart from water, electricity and oth er Civic Amenities.  We \\nwould be engaging financial & technical consultants thi s year and \\nimplementation would commence in the next financial ye ar.  \\n    \\n    \\n5. 5. 5. 5.
